# Machine-Learning-Project-With-R
This is a simple machine learning code with R, which performs training, 5-Fold testing, and plotting the result.
The used algorithm to create models are: XGBoost, SVM, Random Forests, and AdaBoost.
Finally, the datasets are: glass0, vehicle0, spambase, and twonorm.

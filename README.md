# Machine-Learning-Project-With-R
This is a simple machine learning code with R, which performs training and 5-Fold testing on given datasets, then plotting and printing the result.
The used algorithm to create models are: XGBoost, SVM, Random Forests, and AdaBoost.
The datasets are: glass0, vehicle0, spambase, and twonorm.
